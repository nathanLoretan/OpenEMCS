# OpenEMCS
This project was a Univeristy project.

OpenEMCS stands for Open Electrical Measurement and Control System. The idea of the project was to develop a fully open source framework to control and measure electric loads over an IP based network. https://wiki.openemcs.org/. It was a Bachelor's semester project.

This reposit presents the code which can be load on a raspberry Pi which display a terminal interface to control the server. A node will measure current and voltage from a external board connected to a Rasberry Pi and a server will connect the measurement of the different node in the netwrok.
